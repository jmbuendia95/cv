    <h3>A couple of my projects</h3>
    <h4>Web Development</h4>
    <p>
      My friend breed French bulldogs, and I did a quick webpage for his business,
      <a href="Rico_webpage/index.html" target="_blank">Huggable Frenchies</a><br />

    </p>
    <h4>Mosfet Electronics</h4>
    <p>
      I did a couple of projects involving design of Digital electronics at the Mosfet Level.<br />
      One of them was a solo project located
      <a href="http://cmosedu.com/jbaker/courses/ee421L/f15/students/buendiaj/project/Project.html" target="_blank">here</a><br />
      <br />
      Another project which involved Mosfet design of Digital Electronics was completed with a group.<br />
      My team members were: Jared Hayes, Shada sharif, and Stephanie Silic.<br />
      That project can be found <a href="http://cmosedu.com/jbaker/courses/ee421L/f15/students/silics/Lab8/lab8.html" target="_blank">here</a><br />
